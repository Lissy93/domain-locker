If you're managing more than a couple of domains, it’s worth taking a minute to get organised.

**Tags** help you group domains by category.  
**Links** let you save useful bookmarks related to each domain. Together, they make Domain Locker feel like your own custom dashboard.

### Tags: Categorise Your Domains

Tags are great for filtering, sorting, or just adding a bit of context.

You can tag domains however you like — by client, environment, purpose, or anything else:

- `🎯 Marketing`  
- `💼 Client: Acme Ltd`  
- `🔒 Critical`  
- `🇪🇺 EU Markets`  

Each tag can have a name (required), and optionally:

- An icon (Font Awesome format)  
- A colour  
- A short description  

Domains can have **zero or more tags**.  
You can manage your tags and which domains they apply to at [**/assets/tags**](/assets/tags).

### Links: Save Helpful Bookmarks

Links let you store domain-specific URLs directly in Domain Locker — so everything is in one place.

Some ideas:

- Admin dashboard  
- GitHub repo  
- Hosting provider  
- Analytics for the domain  
- DNS control panel  
- Search Console  
- CRM or support tool  

Each link has a title and a URL. You can add as many as you like per domain.  
View and manage them under [**/assets/links**](/assets/links), or on the domain detail page.

### Why Use Tags & Links?
With Domain Locker, you can categorise your domains under tags, and include links to all domain-related resources.

- Stay organised as your domain list grows  
- Find what you need quickly  
- Make it easier for your team to jump in  
- Reduce time spent digging for login pages or settings

Both tags and links are optional — but if you're managing 10+ domains, they really help keep things tidy.
