### Debugging

1. Confirm that you've correctly followed the setup, either in the [Developing Docs](/about/developing) or [Self-Hosting Docs](/about/self-hosting)
2. And ensure you are using the latest version of Domain Locker / Docker / Node, etc
3. Check the logs (in your terminal) for any obvious errors or warnings
4. In the app, navigate to `/advanced/debug-info` to view system status and logs
5. Using the info from the logs, deduce if it's:
  <br>A) A domain locker issue, in which case check the source code [here](https://github.com/lissy93/domain-locker)
  <br>B) A third-party issue, in which case check the [Third-Party Docs](/about/developing/third-party-docs)
