In order to self-host Domain Locker, you will need a server. This can be anything from a low-powered SBC like a Raspberry Pi to a dedicated VPS. You will need to take care of securing, managing and updating your instance, as well as maintaining availability, backup schedule and provisioning resources. 

The self-hosted edition comes with no warranty. There are no guarantees for functionality and maintaining and securing the infrastructure will be your responsibility.

If you deploy the code as-is, you must not charge users for access to your instance, without prior consent from Domain Locker's author.

## Prerequisites
Domain Locker is intended to be run as a Docker stack. You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server.
You may also need a domain name and a valid SSL certificate for that domain.
