## About

The aim of Domain Locker, is to give you complete visibility of your domain name portfolio, in once central place.

For each domain you add, we analyse it and fetch all associated data. We then continuously monitor your domains, and notify you (according to your preferences) when something important changes or when it's soon to expire. 

You'll get detailed domain analysis, security insights, change history, recent performance, valuation data and much more. Never loose track of your domains, miss an expiration, or forget which registrar and providers each domain uses.
